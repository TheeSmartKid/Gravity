TO MAKE SURE THIS WORKS MAKES SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED

ONCE YOU HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED, WRITE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND

  pip install pygame
  
  pip install pytmx

once you have done that whenever you wana play open terminal and write the following command:
  cd "directory name"
  python main.py

for example:
